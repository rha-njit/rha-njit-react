      {/*Advocacy
        Through resident feedback, we recognize a problem and create a
              solution. We are here to better your residential experience
              whether it be free laundry or simply maintaining your residence
              hall.
        Programming
        Our innovative programs (that include, but are not limited to:
              cultural awareness and health/wellness) are also an opportunity
              for residents to interact with one another and engage everyone in
              the NJIT community
        Leadership Development
        As a student run organization, we strive to strengthen our
              residents abilities to lead through involvement on campus
        Residential Hall Council
        Every residence hall belongs to a Residential Hall Council.
                    Similar to a city hall meeting, this is the easiest way for
                    residents to directly get involved in their community.
        General Body Meetings
        Every week on Firday the Residence Hall Association holds a
                    General Body Meeting. This would be a great place to voice
                    your concerns about living on campus.
        The Committees
        The Programming and Delegation committees are a fun way to
                    get involved with the organization. Visit the page for more
                    information.
