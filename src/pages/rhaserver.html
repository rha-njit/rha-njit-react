            You play on an online server by locating and connecting to the IP address of a multiplayer server.
A multiplayer server allows two or more players to play Minecraft together. You can either download the server file needed to set up your own server from Minecraft.net or connect to another personâ€™s server.
To connect to another player's server, log into Minecraft, select Multiplayer from the main menu, click the Add Server button, and enter the IP or web address of that server. If you don't know the IP of a server, thousands of public servers can be located by doing a web search for something that suits your style of play.
Note that to access a server you need to run the same version of Minecraft as the server. If you need help with this, you can learn more in our article on Changing game version.
For general information about servers, see the Minecraft Wiki's server page. For more detailed information on setting up your own server, check out the wiki's Server Tutorials.
