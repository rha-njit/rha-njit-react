    <p>
      Newark is located just 8 miles away from New York City and is the
      largest city in New Jersey. Over the last thirty years, Newark has worked
      hard to grow into an important industrial hub and become what it is today.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/CKB.jpg" style="float:right" width="800" height="400"/>
      <p>It is one of the nation’s major air, shipping, and rail hubs and
      is one of the most populous cities in New Jersey.
     
      </p>
     <p> The city is rich with culture and history and with Newark’s accessible
      transportation system, it is easy to find the hidden beauty of the city.
      Branch Brook Park, which is a quick train ride away, holds more than 4,100
      cherry trees (the largest collection of cherry blossom trees in the nation).</p>
      <p>The Newark Museum, which is right next door to our campus, holds beautiful art
      galleries. There are also quite a lot of entertainment options, including
      Prudential Center, NJPAC, the Red Bull Arena, and Newark Symphony Hall.</p>
      <p>Newark’s Ironbound district is one of the more affluent neighborhoods in the area.
      It is populated with many restaurants, mini markets and clothing stores and
      is vibrant with culture. This neighborhood has a mix of different ethnicities,
      which contributes to its amazing community. There are also beautiful places to visit,
      including Independence Park and the Passaic River waterfront, which offers
      the “Orange Boardwalk” with views of the water.</p>
